## Plot
Below is an interacive bar chart that shows the total number of victims due to mass shootings in each month in the year of 2018. 
`r interactive_chart`
My question is, in which month is there most victim due to mass shootings? 

The bar chart shows us that the month with most people killed and injuried under mass shootings is June. 
I chose to use a bar chart becasue bar chart is good at comparing numbers with the height of each bar. My question was asking the heighest number of victims, and the bar chart visualizes number into bars, with higher bar for larger number. In this way, I can easily tell that the bar for month June is heighest and can answer the question.
